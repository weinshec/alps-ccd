ALPS-CCD
========

This repository is a fork of the analysis code repository designed to work with
the CCD used at ALPS created by eikevons_. It contains my own modifications and
additions.

Installation
------------

The code was designed against **Python2** and provides a ``setup.py``
containing metadata and dependencies. Install it via ``pip``, i.e.:

.. code:: shell

   cd alps-ccd
   pip install -e .

The ``-e`` options installs the package remaining its ability to change during
development.
